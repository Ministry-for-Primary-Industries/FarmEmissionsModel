# Introduction

This file contains an accessible and ordinal library of R functions that
perform the equations prescribed by the Farm Emission Model methodology
(available
[here](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/funding-rural-support/environment-and-natural-resources/estimating-on-farm-emissions)).
Standalone it does not complete a farm-level emissions estimation

This system of R functions are:

-   separated into self-contained modules, currently covering livestock
    and synthetic fertiliser emissions

-   named in the form `eq_femD_X()` where digit `D` refers to the
    relevant chapter in the FEM methodology and string `X` refers to the
    output of the equation being calculated

    -   a single function may wrap multiple intermediate equations found
        in the methodology as it calculates the output `X`

    -   if child functions exist within the above, they handle
        conditional logic. For instance: sectoral variation in the
        calculation of X. These are prefixed `feq` and suffixed with a
        simple description of the condition(s) that apply
        e.g. `feq_deer()` applies to deer

As this model is adapted from Ministry for Primary Industries’ national
[Agricultural GHG Inventory
Methodology](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/dmsdocument/13906/direct) (**AIM**)
we note that:

-   any algebra typically follows the format of the AIM equations
    (referenced in the FEM methodology). In some cases refactoring has
    been done for clarity and/or to enable generalisation of multiple
    AIM equations into a single function

-   equation parameter names generally mirror those in AIM

We place a high priority on parameter consistency. The equations and
their parameters are modified from AIM where necessary to ensure
consistent timeframes, units and representation of
percentages/allocations/weights/proportions such that they are:

-   defined in per animal terms unless explicitly noted

-   for parameters defined in terms of a time period, we use monthly
    unless explicitly noted

-   explicitly note unit of mass. Our default is kg where appropriate

-   all percentage and allocation parameters explicitly contain this in
    their names and are always in decimal form e.g. 5% = 0.05

Examples:

-   `DMI_kg` is the dry matter intake (of the farm-level diet) in kg,
    per animal, of a given StockClass, in a given Month
-   `N_pct_Diet` is the Nitrogen percentage of the diet, for a given
    StockClass, in a given Month

# Global Helper Lists

Helper lists used in multiple equations across the system are defined
here:

``` r
stockClassList_newborns <- c(
  # beef
  "Bulls R1", "Heifers R1", "Steers R1",
  # dairy
  "Dairy Heifers R1", "Dairy Bulls R1",
  # deer
  "Hinds R1", "Stags R1", 
  # sheep
  "Lambs"
) # used by eq_fem3_ME_Z0, eq_fem3_ME_Z1

stockClassList_lactatingMothers <- c(
  # beef
  "Heifers R3", "Cows Mature",
  # dairy
  "Milking Cows Mature",
  # deer
  "Hinds Mature",
  # sheep
  "Ewe Hoggets", "Ewes Mature"
) # ustockClassList_pregnantMotherssed by: eq_fem3_ME_l, eq_fem5_N_Retained_Milk_kg

stockClassList_newborns_lactatingMothers <- append(
  stockClassList_newborns,
  stockClassList_lactatingMothers
) # used by: eq_fem3_k_l
```

# Module 1: Livestock Emissions

## Components of ME_total:

### Q_m

The ratio of metabolisable to gross energy for feed. An intermediate
output necessary for ME_l and ME_m calculations via k_l and k_m
respectively

``` r
eq_fem3_Q_m <- function(
    ME_Diet_AIM, # assumedParameters lookup
    GE_Diet=18.45 # AIM sets 18.45 in all cases
    ) {
  
  # ref FEM equation 3.1
  
  Q_m <- ME_Diet_AIM / GE_Diet
  
  return(Q_m)
  
}
```

### ME_l

Calculates the metabolisable energy required for lactation in relevant
mother stock classes

#### ME_l Part 1: Dairy production - Mature Milking Dairy Cows only

This prepares farm data inputs on:

-   Milk yield from L/herd to kg/animal

-   Milk solids content from kg/herd to percentage terms \[on a
    mass:mass percentage basis, consistent with the academic literature
    and how percentages are usually prescribed, but notably different
    from the mass:volume basis form (i.e. kg milk solid / L milk) that
    milk solid percentages are generally communicated to a farmer by
    milk processors\]

``` r
eq_fem3_Milk_Yield_Herd_kg <- function(
    Milk_Yield_Herd_L # farm data input
) {
  
  # ref FEM equation 3.2
  
  # convert farm input of dairy herd milk yield in volume (L) to mass (kg)
  
  Milk_Yield_Herd_kg = Milk_Yield_Herd_L * 1.03
  
  return(Milk_Yield_Herd_kg)
  
}

eq_fem3_Milk_Fat_pct <- function(
    Milk_Fat_Herd_kg, # farm data input
    Milk_Yield_Herd_kg # farm data input
) {
  
  # ref FEM equation 3.3
  
  Milk_Fat_pct = Milk_Fat_Herd_kg / Milk_Yield_Herd_kg
  
  return(Milk_Fat_pct)
  
}

eq_fem3_Milk_Protein_pct <- function(
    Milk_Protein_Herd_kg, # farm data input
    Milk_Yield_Herd_kg # calculated in system
) {
  
  # ref FEM equation 3.4

}

    Milk_Yield_Herd_kg, # farm data input
    StockCount_mean # farm data input. Mean StockCount of given StockClass in a given month
) {
  
  # ref FEM equation 3.5
  
  # convert herd Milk Yield to per animal terms
  
  # coalesce NAs to zero
  Milk_Yield_Herd_kg <- coalesce(Milk_Yield_Herd_kg, 0)

    return(ME_Z0_pct)
    
  }
  
  case_when(
    StockClass %in% stockClassList_newborns ~ feq_newborns(),
    TRUE ~ 0
  )

}

eq_fem3_ME_Z1 <- function(
    StockClass, # only applies to newborns
    Milk_Newborn_kg, # derived in preproc from farm data / AIM assumptions
    MilkPowder_Newborn_kg, # derived in preproc from farm data / AIM assumptions

### ME_Graze

The metabolisable energy required to roam for grazing. Applies to cattle
and sheep

``` r
eq_fem3_ME_Graze <- function(
    Sector, # sectoral variation
    DMD_pct_Diet_AIM, # calculated in system.
    ME_m, # calculated in system
    ME_p, # calculated in system
    ME_Z1, # calculated in system
    LW_kg, # assumedParameters lookup
    k_m, # calculated in system
    ME_Diet_AIM, # assumedParameters lookup
    ME_c, # calculated in system
    MonthDays
) {
  
  # ref FEM equations 3.35 - 3.36
  
  feq_cattle_sheep <- function(C, GF, T) {
    
    ME_Graze_day = (

    Sector == "Deer" ~ 0 # AIM: ME_Graze does not apply to Deer
  )
  
}
```

## ME_total

The individual components of ME sum to give ME_total_pre_ME_Z: the
amount of metabolisable energy used (i.e. required) by an animal in a
given month

This is then adjusted for ME_Z to give ME_total: the amount of
metabolisable energy to be satisfied by dry matter intake (i.e. the
farm-level diet which excludes milk)

The latter value is used in subsequent equations

``` r
eq_fem3_ME_total_pre_ME_Z <- function(
    # base ME components: all stock classes
    ME_m, # calculated in system
    # graze/conceptus/production ME components: specific stock classes
    ME_Graze, # calculated in system
    ME_c, # calculated in system
    ME_p # calculated in system
) {
  
  # ref FEM equation 3.37
  
  # calculation of total metabolisable energy, before adjustments for ME_Z
  
  ME_total_pre_ME_Z <- ME_m + ME_p + ME_Graze + ME_c
  
  return(ME_total_pre_ME_Z)
  
}

eq_fem3_ME_total <- function(
    ME_total_pre_ME_Z, # calculated in system
    ME_Z0_pct, # calculated in system
    ME_Z1 # calculated in system
) {
  
  # ref FEM equation 3.38
  
  # calculation of total metabolisable energy, after adjustments for ME_Z
  
  # coalesce NAs
  ME_Z0_pct = coalesce(ME_Z0_pct, 0)
  
  ME_total <- (ME_total_pre_ME_Z - ME_Z1) * (1 - ME_Z0_pct)
  
  return(ME_total)
  
}
```

## Farm-level Diet

This is a relatively complex function within the system. Parts 1 and 3
of the function handle pre and post processing respectively. Related
equations are split into five sequentially numbered sections in Part 2.
Uniquely this function **ingests multiple dataframes** and **outputs
multiple values**, the farm-level diet parameters:

-   ME_Diet
-   DMD_pct_Diet
-   N_pct_Diet

``` r
eq_fem4_derive_farm_diet_parameters <- function(
    in_df, # processing calculation df after ME_totals have been calculated
    inputs_supplements_df, # farm data input of supplementary feed purchased
    inputs_supplements_sector_allocation, # farm data input of the % of supplementary feed purchased is relevant to sector being calculated
    lookup_nutrientProfile_supplements_df, # lookup table of supplementary feed nutritional profile
    lookup_nutrientProfile_pasture_df # lookup table of pasture nutritional profile
) {
  
  # ref FEM equations 4.1 - 4.18
  
  # Part 1: Data Prep
  
  # pasture nutritional profile is different for dairy vs. non-dairy: find relevant sector from in_df

## Dry Matter Intake

Mass of diet consumed based on energy requirements (ME_total) and energy
content of diet (ME_Diet)

``` r

    ) {
  
  # ref FEM equation 4.19

  DMI_kg <- ME_total / ME_Diet
  
  return(DMI_kg)

}
```

## Nitrogen Intake and Excretion

### Nitrogen Intake

The mass of Nitrogen consumed by the animal from dry matter intake
(and/or milk for newborn stock classes)

``` r

    MilkPowder_Protein_pct=0, # assumedParameters lookup
    DMI_kg, # calculated in system

### Nitrogen Retained

Depending on Sector and StockClass, some Nitrogen intake is used for
production (and therefore non-excretion) use. These uses are:

-   Milk

-   Live Weight Gain

-   Fetal Weight Gain

-   Wool

-   Velvet

The Nitrogen utilised for the above is subtracted from Nitrogen intake
to find Nitrogen excreted

``` r

### Nitrogen Excreted

Various Nitrous Oxide emissions factors are calculated from the N
excreted via dung and urine respectively. First the N_Excretion_kg is
calculated and then this apportioned to an excretion pathway

``` r
eq_fem5_N_Excretion_kg <- function(

    N_Retained_Velvet_kg=0, # calculated in system
    N_Retained_Wool_kg=0 # calculated in system
) {
  
  # ref FEM equation 7.8
  
  # coalesce any NA N_retained values to 0
  N_Retained_Milk_kg <- coalesce(N_Retained_Milk_kg, 0)
  N_Retained_LWG_kg <- coalesce(N_Retained_LWG_kg, 0)
  N_Retained_FWG_kg <- coalesce(N_Retained_FWG_kg, 0)

  N_Excretion_kg <- pmax(N_Excretion_kg, 0)
  
  return(N_Excretion_kg)
  
}
```

### Apportioning Nitrogen Excreted to Dung and Urine

``` r
eq_fem5_N_Dung_kg <- function(
  Sector, # sectoral variation
  N_pct_Diet, # calculated in system
  DMI_kg, # calculated in system
  N_Intake_kg, # calculated in system

  ) {

```

## Enteric Fermentation Methane Emissions

Methane is a by-product of fermentation of food in the rumen of ruminant
animals and largely depends on dry matter intake consumed

The majority of farm-level GHG emissions (in CO2 equivalent terms)
happens here

``` r

## Excretion Emissions

### Faecal Dry Matter

``` r
eq_fem7_FDM_kg <- function(
    DMI_kg, # calculated in system,
    DMD_pct_Diet # calculated in system

```

### Allocation of Excretion to Pasture and Lagoons

The majority of stock classes deposit all excretion to pasture. However,
mature milking dairy cows deposit 9.4% of excretion in the months
they’re milking (from “Trends in dairy effluent management (2017) p.25)

The allocation to pasture is simply all of the excretion not deposited
as effluent

``` r
eq_fem7_DungUrine_to_Lagoon_pct <- function(
    StockClass, # StockClass variation
    Milk_Yield_kg # calculated in system
    ) {
  
  # ref FEM equations 7.2a - 7.2b
  
  DungUrine_to_Lagoon_pct = case_when(
    StockClass == "Milking Cows Mature" & Milk_Yield_kg > 0 ~ 0.094,
    TRUE ~ 0
  )
  
  return(DungUrine_to_Lagoon_pct)
  
}

```

### Effluent Excretion Emissions

CH4 and volatilised N2O emissions from excretion to Anaerobic Lagoons

*Note effluent is only relevant to mature milking cows and only for
months when milk production is occurring.*

### Effluent Spread as Organic Fertiliser Emissions

*Note Organic Fertiliser here is limited to mature milking cow effluent
from lagoons spread to pasture. It only applies to mature milking cows
and only when milk production is occurring.*

# Module 2: Synthetic Fertiliser Emissions

Note there are 3 types of synthetic fertiliser considered:

-   Urease-inhibitor coated Urea

-   Urea (uncoated)

-   Non-urea nitrogen-containing synthetic fertiliser (referred to in
    shorthand as otherSynthFert)

Organic fertiliser is out of scope, except for dairy effluent spread
onto pasture as described in the previous section.

## Synthetic Fertiliser Carbon Dioxide Emissions

Urea, both urease-inhibitor coated and uncoated, has a direct pathway of
CO2 emissions, the only emissions of CO2 across FEM

``` r
eq_fem8_CO2_SynthFert_t <- function(
    N_urea_coated_t, # farm data input
    N_urea_uncoated_t, # farm data input
    C_pct_Urea=0.2, # set by AIM
    corr_CO2=44/12 # set by AIM
    ) {
  
  # ref FEM equations 8.6 - 8.7
  
  M_urea_all_t <- (N_urea_coated_t + N_urea_uncoated_t) / 0.46
  
  CO2_SynthFert_t <- M_urea_all_t * C_pct_Urea * corr_CO2

  return(CO2_SynthFert_t)

}
```
